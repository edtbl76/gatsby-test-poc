I started [emangini.com](https://emangini.com) about a year ago with the idea that I was going to post about 
"my interests".

This posed a number of problems.

First of all, I'm interested in about everything. Second, if you are interested in everything, you don't end up writing 
squat.

One of my favorite podcasts is the Joe Rogan Experience. He has guests from a fairly wide range of subject matters, 
many of which I have an interest. I noticed that my approach to writing was to attempt to be the ultimate Joe Rogan 
guest. The problem is that I would need to live a hundred lifetimes to be an expert in all of those fields.

I stopped writing, confused about how to proceed.

The site just sat there for a while. Consistency is a challenge, but it is even harder without something to drive it.

The site was linked to a Facebook page I had created for it. After a period of inactivity, Facebook sends 
notifications to your personal account to "use it or lose it".

I'm an avid reader. Since I abandoned my page I've ready several dozen books. The subject matter is almost entirely 
devoted to software development, architecture and technology.

I looked at my Kindle and my various other eReader apps, and aside from a handful of digitally-dog-eared references I 
use for some external interests, my library is a compilation of technical literature.

I decided that rather than pack it in, let's pivot the way Richard and the gang did. (Just please don't read this on a 
Hooli phone.)

I'm going to write what I know well, and what I continue to learn more about. Software.

Yeah, there are a lot of tech blogs out there. Why not one more? The web is a pretty big place.
